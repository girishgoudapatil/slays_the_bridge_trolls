Using blockchains to eliminate trust from eInvoicing gateways
=============================================================

This stuff is in our repo here https://github.com/monkeypants/slays_the_bridge_trolls

Two things that are so hot right now:
 * eInvoicing, because of potential national productivity benefits
 * blockchains, because society stopped implicitly trusting banks

Relevant public data / APIs
 * ABR, reliable list of all Australian businesses
 * simulated OIDC Identity Provider for authenticating Australian Businesses (and providing consent-based authorisation) that leverages existing Commonwealth capability

The national productivity benefits promised by a national eInvoicing system come from:
 * reducing buyer and seller costs associated with invoice processing
 * improving accountability and counter-party trust
 * new digital oportunities for value-creation

The problems with existing <todo: refs>  eInvoicing standards is that they rely on a network of implicitly trusted gateways, which rely on secrecy and paperwork to provide permiter security.

We believe the fundamental value of eInvoicing is the liquidity it provides,

This axiom leads to a set of principles that can maximise the national productivity an eInvoicing scheme can achieve:
 * maximise liquidity by pushing trust and sophistocation to the edge of the network
 * bridge-trolls are bad; avoid situations that maximise the value of the traffic to the network, seek situations that **maximise the value of the network to the traffic**

This is why we intend to demonstrate key elements of a working eInvoicing system that:
 * links the identity of Australian businesses back to a trusted source, even in a social media context
 * replacees complex infrastructure with a simple transport layer using cryprographic protocols
 * usees blockchain ledger to make gateways accountable for preventing collusion,
 * shows how a smart eInvoicing protocol design can recude the cost of finance to Australian businesses, more than doubling the projected national productivity dividend currently anticipated by eInvoicing proponents.

On the way, we will demonstrate how the magic sword of mistrust can slay rent-seeking bridge-trolls, and how Australian businesses could use cryptographic protocls and the blockchain to control the flow of private information across a public, open data network.
